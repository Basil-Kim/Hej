* Hej is an interactive mobile-friendly application that lets users set and keep track of reminders they have accomplished.                                     *
* Through visually appealing layout and design, users can gain a sense of accomplishment and management of their busy schedules.                                *
* Hej allows the user to set a custom profile with a photo and short description.                                                                               *
* The reminders page writes the inputs of the user into the database which then is read by the other functions to the application.                              *
* Data from the user is represented by a visually appealing clock that has a color-based system for helping the user identify patterns in their schedules.      *
* As the color changes to black, the user is reminded that setting too many reminders and attempting to accomplish too many things can have a negative result.  *
